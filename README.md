# rec-site
A demo of a simple bootstrap 3 website.

## No /assets
The /assets directory has been ignored entirely by the .gitignore file to avoid committing video and other large binary files to the repo. See https://robinwinslow.uk/2013/06/11/dont-ever-commit-binary-files-to-git/ for why.

## Adding /assets
To see a working version of the site, you'll need to add an /assets directory at the project root and populated it with the files named in index.html.
